# Dirac notation (bra-ket notation) in python

 Codes that help analytical exploration in quantum mechanics using python.

The init.ipynb file has all the code used in the 00-main-vector_state-density_operator-braket_notation.ipynb file

The 00-main-vector_state-density_operator-braket_notation.ipynb file has a good description of how to use the codes and several application examples.
